# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Superwizard AI is an intelligent Chrome browser extension that transforms natural language commands into automated browser actions. The extension uses advanced AI to understand user intent and execute complex web automation tasks across any website, providing a seamless interface for users to interact with web pages through conversational commands.

The system integrates multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter), provides real-time visual feedback through custom cursors, and maintains a comprehensive action history. It operates through a side panel interface accessible via keyboard shortcuts and supports both simple commands and complex multi-step workflows.

## Requirements

5. WHEN users press Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on Mac) THEN the system SHALL toggle the side panel interface
6. WHEN the extension encounters restricted URLs THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate to Google.com as a fallback

### Requirement 2: AI Provider Integration System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure and use multiple AI providers for automation tasks, so that I can choose the best AI model for my specific needs and have backup options.

5. WHEN a provider fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
6. WHEN managing providers THEN the system SHALL allow users to add, remove, and modify provider configurations

### Requirement 3: Natural Language Command Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input natural language commands that get converted into specific browser actions, so that I can automate web tasks without knowing technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving user input THEN the system SHALL parse natural language commands into structured task requirements
2. WHEN processing commands THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous actions in the conversation
3. WHEN generating prompts THEN the system SHALL include current DOM state, action history, and task instructions
4. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL parse responses into executable actions with proper error handling
5. WHEN commands are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification through the respond action
6. WHEN tasks are complete THEN the system SHALL use the finish action to indicate successful completion

### Requirement 4: DOM Interaction and Action System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to perform precise actions on web page elements, so that my automation tasks are executed accurately and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking elements THEN the system SHALL use data-id attributes for precise element targeting
2. WHEN typing text THEN the system SHALL support setValue actions with proper keyboard event simulation
3. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL handle URL changes and wait for page stability
4. WHEN waiting THEN the system SHALL support configurable delays for dynamic content loading
5. WHEN elements are not found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry logic
6. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL validate element existence before execution
7. WHEN handling forms THEN the system SHALL support proper Enter key (\n) and newline (\r) formatting

### Requirement 5: Visual Feedback and User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about what the AI is doing on the page, so that I can monitor automation progress and understand the system's actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actions are executing THEN the system SHALL display a custom cursor showing the target location
2. WHEN tasks are running THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators in the side panel
3. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of all actions and responses
4. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL support both "Direct" and "Developer" interface modes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators and error messages
6. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL show success/failure status with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 6: State Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings, conversation history, and provider configurations to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't lose my setup and can reference previous interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL persist all user preferences in Chrome storage
2. WHEN managing conversations THEN the system SHALL maintain chat history with timestamps and action details
3. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL use secure local storage with proper encryption
4. WHEN the extension restarts THEN the system SHALL restore previous state and configuration
5. WHEN clearing data THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear history while preserving settings
6. WHEN managing multiple chats THEN the system SHALL support conversation organization and retrieval

### Requirement 7: Task Execution and Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor task execution progress and have control over running automation, so that I can understand what's happening and stop tasks if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting tasks THEN the system SHALL initialize progress tracking with estimated completion steps
2. WHEN tasks are running THEN the system SHALL update progress indicators in real-time
3. WHEN users request interruption THEN the system SHALL provide immediate task stopping capability
4. WHEN tasks fail THEN the system SHALL capture error details and provide recovery options
5. WHEN validating progress THEN the system SHALL use DOM state analysis to confirm action success
6. WHEN handling multi-step tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain context between individual actions

### Requirement 8: Screenshot and Vision Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to see the current page state through screenshots, so that it can make more informed decisions about automation actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen vision is enabled THEN the system SHALL capture page screenshots before AI analysis
2. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL include screenshot data in AI prompts for visual context
3. WHEN storing history THEN the system SHALL optionally save screenshots with action records
4. WHEN vision fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to DOM-only analysis
5. WHEN managing privacy THEN the system SHALL allow users to disable screenshot functionality
6. WHEN capturing screens THEN the system SHALL handle different viewport sizes and page layouts

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling that provides clear feedback and recovery options, so that automation failures don't leave me stuck or confused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actions fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with context
2. WHEN consecutive failures occur THEN the system SHALL stop execution after 3 attempts
3. WHEN network issues arise THEN the system SHALL handle API timeouts and connection errors gracefully
4. WHEN pages change unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL detect navigation and adapt accordingly
5. WHEN elements disappear THEN the system SHALL retry with updated DOM analysis
